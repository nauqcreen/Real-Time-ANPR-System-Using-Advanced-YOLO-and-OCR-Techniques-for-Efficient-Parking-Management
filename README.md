We propose a sophisticated real-time vehicle tracking framework leveraging the cutting-edge YOLO algorithm in versions 9, 10, and 11 for ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition). We implement character recognition and juxtapose two OCR paradigms: Microsoft’s TrOCR and Google’s Tesseract. Identified license plates are automatically registered for entry and exit, and service fees are computed. To fortify the pipeline seamlessly and ensure coherence across diverse functionalities, a Streamlit-based application integrates an intuitive interface into its architecture. The entire system demonstrated exceptional efficacy and precision through the experiments, delivering are silient paradigm for the innovative parking management system to streamline expenditures and optimize manpower.
